After graduating from Monash University in Australia, Duong joined Golden Harvest as Sales Manager and spearheaded the team’s successful penetration of the European market. Then, Duong founded Meete, the leading promotion distribution platform for offline retailers, which distributes to thousands of O2O campaigns. Seven years of experience at Meete working with FnB merchants in Vietnam assisted him to uncover the unmet demand for the provision of fresh food to businesses and restaurants – Chodeli. As the company’s founder, Duong has led Chodeli’s team to generate $90k in sales in just five months and has pledged to reach $2 million by the end of 2023.

As a close friend of Son and utilizing his expertise and connections in the startup ecosystem, Duong embarked on a venture capital journey as an advisor at Son Tech and committed to assisting aspiring founders in Vietnam and Southeast Asia.
